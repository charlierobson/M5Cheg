### Porting Tatung Einstein Chuckie Egg to the Sord M5.

Well this was a thing I didn't think I'd end up doing but here we are. To be honest I thought it was going to be much harder than it turned out to be but that was just luck. A lot of features of the code were totally flukey and helped the port immensely. I chose Chuckie Egg as a target because:
* I like it
* Every system should have it
* It's how I rank retro computer users


TL;DR: Modify MAME to output interesting info, understand enough of the source program using Ghidra/MAME debugger, patch the binary until it works.

Porting is fun. It's also pretty brain scrambling at times but it's one of those things you just have to persevere with. I'm not going to make this a beginners guide. I won't be explaining basic concepts, sorry.

There were a number of milestones which I had in my mind as roughly thus:

* See something on screen
* Make the game respond to you
* Do the sound if I could be arsed

Another one popped into the list as I went along and this was to fix any original bugs that irritated me.
