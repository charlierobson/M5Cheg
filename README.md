### Porting Tatung Einstein Chuckie Egg to the Sord M5.

Well this was a thing I didn't think I'd end up doing but here we are. To be honest I thought it was going to be much harder than it turned out to be but that was just luck. A lot of features of the code were totally flukey and helped the port immensely. I chose Chuckie Egg ('CE') as a target because:

* I like it
* Every system should have it
* It's how I rank retro computer users

I chose the Tatung version as the source because, most significantly, the two systems share a big part of their architecture. Both Z80 and TMS99 video chips. I momentarily thought the M5 had an AY sound chip as well but I have a stupid short memory and didn't remember the absolute ball-ache I had converting the sound when I ported my own game BiggOil. D'oh.

So, porting. TL;DR: Modify MAME to output interesting info, understand enough of the source program using Ghidra/MAME debugger, patch the binary until it works. There you go, you can now go and port something! Porting is fun. It's also pretty brain scrambling at times but it's one of those things you just have to persevere with. I'm not going to make this a beginners guide. I won't be explaining basic concepts, sorry.

There were a number of milestones which I had in my mind as roughly thus:

* See something on screen
* Make the game respond to you
* Do the sound if I could be arsed

Another one popped into the list as I went along and this was to fix any original bugs that irritated me.

Tools what I thought I'd need:
* A copy of MAME built locally in Visual Studio so I can hack it to output helpful information
* All the docs:
  * Z80 programmer's manual
  * TMS programmer's guide
  * AY programmer's guide
  * M5 hardware manual (I wish!) had to make do with schematics
  * Einstein hardware manual.
* A working knowledge of Ghidra
* A hex editor
* Some way of patching the source binary

I hadn't used Ghidra before, and all the binary patching solutions I was aware of didn't fit my requirements so there's another task. Building MAME is something I'm used to so that shouldn't be hard, right..?

But I'm getting ahead of myself. We should see what we're up against. 

#### Step 0. See what we're up against.

Get MAME, all the rommy bits required to run Tatung and Sord, and the CE disk image. Tatung DOS is based off CPM and loads binaries at $100. So start MAME in debug mode, and when the debugger appears G 100 and see what happens. What happened was _very_ interesting. The game is relocated to $8000 and executed there. This was intially puzzling. There's no obvious immediate need for this behaviour. I thought maybe the game was assembled in place with a memory resident assembler but it the reason will reveal itself later.

In some ways this is good news. The M5Multi cart has RAM in the upper 32k memory region so it should run there, all being well, but MAME is a different problem as the default M5 device only has the standard 4K. Looking at the slot devices there's talk of a 32k RAM cart but for the life of me I can't make it work. So a hack it is.

Yak task 1: Make M5 look like an M5 with an M5Multi. 
* Get MAME source. Check out latest from GitHub.
* Get tools.
* Compile it. Man alive this cross platform build is slow. Stop that, it's silly.
* Build MAME with only the M5 and Einstein drivers.
* Do the steps needed to generate the VS project files.
* Build with VS.
* A million errors! All related to some sound thing. Nothing related online.
* Start hacking stuff out of MAME hoping it's not needed.
* Eventually enough is hacked off and the thing builds.

Right. Now it builds let's see how to add 32K RAM. The M5 source is littered with hacks for some weird homebrew setup that a number of people had but is of little interest to me. Hack most of that out leaving a bare M5 driver, apart from the code that puts 32k of RAM in the upper region. I'm trivialising this, it was one of the hardest parts of this process and took best part of a day to get working.

With the Chuckie.com file extracted from the disk image, using the [EinyDSK tools](https://github.com/charlierobson/einsdein-vitamins/tree/master/utils/dsktool) that I wrote, I lopped off the relocator code and saved the raw binary. It's less than 16k in size, which is great news for fitting into a 16K ROM image. I have some experience of putting M5 ROM carts together so I re-purposed the startup ASM code from BiggOil. I included the CE binary in the cart ASM code along with a relocator and assembled it to the roms folder in the MAME directory to make running it easier. I added an entry in the MAME M5 ROMS XML so I could load the cart from the commandline.

Part of the port will be a reproducible 'build pipeline' so that was next. This is a grandiose way of saying I wrote a batch file to automate the build process haha. I love an assembler called BRASS, it's free, cross platform (via Mono) and works great. It's a TASM compatible - which for whatever reason is something people still use despite it not being free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Being able to reproduce the ROM from it constituent parts is important. It will save a lot of pain.



#### Step 1. See something.
